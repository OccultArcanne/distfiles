# distfiles
files that I may use... or not, in my *nix boxes

# Credits

DWM dotfiles, chadwm, and ST, are from siduck, pls any of them use the official in his repos
alias are a mix between sum4n and vpm project.
Some wallpapers are from sum4n and other few from reddit and some random sites that idr their address
Lot of ideas are taken from Siduck and sum4n.
Please, don't use the pkgs in this repo, they are just for experimenting since -atm at least- I don't even know how to do a bash script, so don't put your box in risk, idk what I'm doing so u may want to avoid using any file or script placed here, please use the original repos of Siduck, sum4n, void-linux, suckless and so.
